# pong
This is my very first attempt at creating a game!

I have followed a tutorial and modified the style and commenting of the source code. Some remarks for future projects:

1. I do not find the source code very modular; there is a lot of hard coding involved that I do not like.
2. It would certainly be worth adding extra features, e.g. colour change on score change, sound effects, difficulty increase with score increase. However, I have already decided to implement PacMan, so it is PacMan that I will play around with much more!
3. This has been too easy to follow. However, any other applications I have in my mind that I would like to build feel too difficult, considering my current skills, or too vague. I think it is high time I stopped being such a perfectionist about things and put my foot to the pedal with something genuinely challenging!
